# QEngine
A Fluid Simulation Engine with GPU (OpenCL) acceleration made in Java (<- Okay well I tried but I couldn't get the GPU acceleration working in time lol), designed to be simple to use but allow for complex simulations

*Made for my IB Computer Science Internal Assessment*

Currently, it:
  - Lets you simulate fluids in real timeusing SPH
  - Lets you change parameters while the simulation is running
  - Lets you create Inflow and Outflow objects
  
Planned features:
  - Get the GPU simulation to work properly,
  - Import 3D Objects and collide with them,
  - Keyframe object properties,
  - Save & Load scenes,
  - Export the final simulation,
  
Putting it on Github because 
  1. It was hard as balls to make so maybe it'll help someone else trying to do this
  2. As a backhup
